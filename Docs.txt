USAGES:

NOTES:
- This is not a blind followed instructions, but it will require some background knowledge in general development in Windows, VS, .NET and C#
- You cannot ignore the basic principles like patterns, oop, API etc..you name it

Development time:
=================
Used assemblies:
+ MSA.Zmq.JsonRpc
+ Dependencies based on conditions and project

Steps:
1. Add a simple project that will function as single worker server, console app will be enough with the minimum codes in the entry program:

            var pub = Worker.Create(3001);
            pub.AddHandlerType(typeof(CommonLookup));
            pub.Start();

            Console.WriteLine("Press ENTER to exit...");
            Console.ReadLine();

            pub.Dispose();
            

2. Run the program as one of the item in multiple startup solution



Deployment time:
================
Used assemblies:
+ MSA.Zmq.JsonRpc
+ MSA.Zmq.Service
+ Dependencies based on conditions and project

Steps:
1. Modify the application configuration file by listing the assemblies that contain the service handler
2. Put the assemblies in the same folder with the service program itself
3. Install the service as router
4. Install the service as worker
5. Start the services
6. Set the logging level or check the log file when needed for diagnostic
